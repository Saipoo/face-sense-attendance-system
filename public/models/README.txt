# Face API Models

The required face-api.js model files should be automatically downloaded when the server starts.

If the models are not downloaded automatically, you can manually download them from:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Required model files:
1. tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
2. tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
3. face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
4. face_landmark_68_model-shard1
5. face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
6. face_recognition_model-shard1
7. face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
8. face_expression_model-shard1

These files are required for face detection, recognition, and expression analysis.
